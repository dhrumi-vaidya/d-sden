Below is a single, consolidated Lovable super-prompt that embeds everything:
terminal-first UI, CLI spec, homepage command flow, and Frontend Infra / UI Platform / systems-leaning FE alignment.

This is ready to copy-paste into Lovable or any UI-gen tool.

Lovable Prompt: Terminal-First, FAANG-Aligned, Frontend Infrastructure Portfolio

Design a terminal-first, mobile-first developer portfolio that behaves like a production-grade frontend system, not a personal website.

The target persona is a Frontend Infrastructure / UI Platform / systems-leaning frontend engineer.
The interface must communicate FAANG-level engineering rigor, architectural thinking, performance awareness, and ownership—without marketing language.

Core Concept

The portfolio is an interactive system interface inspired by internal developer tools, CLIs, IDEs, and system dashboards.
Visitors explore the portfolio by issuing commands, not scrolling pages.

This should feel like inspecting a real engineering system.

Primary Interface (Terminal-First)

Terminal-inspired UI as the primary navigation surface

Command-driven exploration with autocomplete and tap-friendly suggestions

Dark-mode first, high-contrast, readable typography

Visual inspiration from system design tools, internal dashboards, IDEs—not dribbble or marketing sites

Mobile-First Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

Designed for small screens first

Terminal interactions optimized for tap, swipe, and expandable blocks

No hover-only affordances

Fast initial load, low cognitive overhead

CLI COMMAND SYSTEM (MUST BE IMPLEMENTED)

Global behavior

Commands autocomplete

Output is concise by default

Depth is unlocked via flags (--deep, --arch, --impact)

No verbose dumps unless explicitly requested

Core commands

help        → list available commands and intent
status      → system overview / landing state
projects    → major systems and platforms shipped
project X   → deep dive into a specific system
skills      → capability map by system domain
arch        → frontend architecture philosophy
perf        → performance strategy and case studies
tooling     → build systems, CI/CD, internal tools
decisions   → key engineering trade-offs
about       → concise technical profile
contact    → minimal professional contact


Required flags

--deep → architecture, trade-offs, lessons

--impact → measurable outcomes (latency, DX, scale)

--infra → platform-level skills only

Homepage / First-10-Seconds Experience

On load, show a fast, minimal terminal boot:

Frontend System Interface v1.0
Type 'help' to explore


Provide tap-friendly suggested commands:

Suggested:
• status
• projects
• arch


Executing status must immediately reveal:

Role focus: Frontend Infrastructure / UI Platform

Core domains: Rendering, Performance, Tooling, Architecture

Evidence of scale and ownership

The goal is that within 10 seconds, a reviewer understands:
This engineer builds and scales frontend systems.

Gamification (Subtle, Serious, Non-Toy)

Projects are missions defined by constraints, scale, and outcomes

Skills evolve as capabilities, not percentages

Experience is shown as system maturity, not a timeline

Achievements reflect real engineering milestones (scale, reliability, performance, platform adoption)

Animation Rules (Strict)

Every animation must communicate state, hierarchy, or progress

No decorative motion

Animations must feel like system feedback (loading, resolving, expanding, unlocking)

Performance-safe and minimal

Content Principles

No buzzwords

No motivational copy

No résumé language

Assume a technical audience

Content should read like:

Internal documentation

Design review summaries

Architecture notes

Goal

Make the viewer feel like they are reviewing a well-designed frontend platform and conclude:

“This developer thinks in systems, understands trade-offs, and builds frontend infrastructure at scale.”
