Design a minimal, mobile-first landing page for a developer portfolio that transitions into an existing terminal-based portfolio system.

This page is not the portfolio itself. Its only job is to:

Orient the visitor

Set expectations

Hand off cleanly into terminal mode

Visual Theme (Light Mode Only)

Light theme, high readability

Clean, calm, neutral palette

No gradients, no decoration for decoration’s sake

Visual inspiration: internal docs, design tools, engineering dashboards

The landing page must visually contrast with the dark terminal mode, making the transition feel intentional.

Tone & Copy

Technical, calm, confident

No marketing language

No “passionate developer” messaging

Assume a technical audience

Content Structure

1. Header / Identity

Name

Role focus: Frontend Infrastructure / UI Platform / Systems-leaning Frontend

Keep this understated and precise.

2. What This Is
One short paragraph:

“This is my developer portfolio.
It’s built as an interactive system rather than a static website.”

3. How It Works
Max 3 bullets, concise:

Explore projects, architecture, and impact through a terminal interface

Commands reveal depth (projects, arch, perf)

Designed for engineers and technical reviewers

4. Intent Signal
One calm line reinforcing credibility:

“The terminal reflects how I think about frontend systems: structure, constraints, and trade-offs.”

Primary CTA (Mandatory)

Fixed bottom-right button

Label: “Enter Terminal Mode”

Subtle but clearly visible

No animation beyond a small state change (hover / tap feedback only)

Clicking this transitions into the existing terminal system.

Interaction Rules

Mobile-first layout

No hover-only interactions

All spacing and typography optimized for scanning

Zero unnecessary animation

What NOT to Include

No project cards

No skills list

No timelines

No stats or metrics

No dark theme here

This page must stay intentionally minimal and defer all depth to terminal mode.

Goal

Before entering terminal mode, the visitor should think:

“This person builds systems, not slides.”
